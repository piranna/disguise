Disguise an object giving it the appearance of another

This code was originally included as part of the [Kurento](http://kurento.org)
Javascript Client library whom I was the author, and it was distributed as
[LGPL 2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html). I extracted and published
it as an independent module and later improved it with correct Promises support.
